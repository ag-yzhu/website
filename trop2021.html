</header>
<div class="post-body">
<p>This virtual minicourse on tropical geometry aims to deliver some classical knowledge on the subject as well as some reports on current day advances. Topics include introduction to definitions of tropical varieties, balancing conditions, tropical curves and its connection with matroid theory, cohomology theory for tropical varieties, tropical analogies of plane curves, tropicall Riemann-Roch and tropical Brill-Noether, applications in the study of moduli space, and some recent results on the computation of top weight rational cohomology for g-dimensional moduli space of abelian varieties.</p>

<h3>Kris Shaw:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Lecture 1. A brief introduction to tropical geometry </dt>

  <dd><b>Time:</b> Wednesday 6/9 20:00 (GMT+8)</dd>

  <dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: 840 0465 8756</dd>

  <dd><b>Abstract:</b>This will be a gentle introduction to our main objects, tropical varieties, which are polyhedral complexes in Euclidean space with extra structure, namely a balancing condition. I will also explain the stable intersection of tropical varieties in real spaces.</dd>

  <dt>Lecture 2. Tropical geometry and matroids</dt>
  <dd><b>Time:</b> </dd>

  <dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: </dd>

  <dd><b>Abstract:</b>I will end by describing tropical varieties of degree 1 and their connections to matroid theory. Every matroid produces a tropical linear space and many matroid invariants can be recovered as algebro-geometric invariants. The invariants from algebraic geometry that can be transported to the study of matroids include intersection theory, cohomology theories, characteristic classes (Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes). The analogy with algebraic geometry
</dd>

  <dt>Lecture 3. Tropical cohomology and its properties</dt>
  <dd><b>Time:</b> </dd>

  <dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: </dd>

  <dd><b>Abstract:</b>In this talk I will describe a cohomology theory for tropical varieties that shares many properties with Weil cohomology theories for non-singular projective varieties. For example, Poincaré duality, Lefschetz theorems, and Hodge Riemann bilinear relations. I will also explain a tropical version of the Hodge conjecture due to Mikhalkin and Zharkov.

<h3>Nathan Pflueger</h3>
<dt>Lecture 1. Tropical plane curves</dt>
<dd><b>Time:</b> Friday 6/11 20:30 (GMT+8)</dd>

<dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: 840 0465 8756 </dd>

<dd><b>Abstract:</b> I will describe the tropical analogs of plane curves, which are graphs embedded in the plane with all edges embedded as line segments of rational slope. I will discuss tropical analogs of several facts about algebraic plane curves, with particular emphasis on Bézout's theorem. Depending on time and interest, I may discuss some aspects to enumerative geometry of algebraic curves on toric surfaces, or describe how the story carries over to higher dimensional tropical varieties.
</dd>

<dt>Lecture 2. Tropical Riemann-Roch and Brill-Noether theory</dt>
<dd><b>Time:</b> Tuesday 6/15 09:00 (GMT+8)</dd>

<dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: 835 1619 7249  </dd>

<dd><b>Abstract:</b> I will introduce abstract tropical curves, and illustrate the analogy between them and algebraic curves with the tropical Riemann-Roch formula. I will then discuss special divisors and tropical curves, and some results on tropical Brill-Noether theory.
</dd>

<dt>Lecture 3. Tropical curves via specialization and non-archimedean analytification</dt>
<dd><b>Time:</b> Thursday 6/17 09:00 (GMT+8)</dd>

<dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: 835 1619 7249  </dd>

<dd><b>Abstract:</b> I will describe the bridge between abstract algebraic curves and abstract tropical curves. This bridge has been well-traveled in the past decade; it allows theorems about tropical curves to be carried back across the bridge to prove theorems about algebraic curves, and vice versa. I will discuss this bridge from two different but closely related points of view: specialization in semistable families of algebraic curves and contraction to the skeleton of the non-archimedean analytification.

<h3>Juliette Bruce</h3>
<dt>Lecture 1. On the top-weight rational cohomology of A_g (part 1)</dt>
<dd><b>Time:</b> Thursday 6/10 09:30 (GMT+8)</dd>

<dd><b>Venue:</b> Zoom room number: 835 1619 7249</dd>

<dd><b>Abstract:</b>  I will discuss recent work calculating the top weight cohomology of the moduli space \mathcal{A}_{g} of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g for small values of g. The key idea is that this piece of cohomology is encoded combinatorially via the relationship between the boundary complex of a compactification of \mathcal{A}_{g} and the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties. This is joint work with Madeline Brandt, Melody Chan, Margarida Melo, Gwyneth Moreland, and Corey Wolfe.</dd>

<dt>Lecture 2. On the top-weight rational cohomology of A_g (part 2)</dt>
<dd><b>Time:</b> Friday 6/11 09:30 (GMT+8)</dd>
