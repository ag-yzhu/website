<div class="post-body">
<p>I am a Ph.D. in mathematics specialized in algebraic geometry and arithmetics.
  I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.math.brown.edu/~bhassett/">Brendan Hassett</a>.</p>

<h2>What I study:</h2>

<p>In a broader sense, I am interested in representation theory and things matrix-y.</p>

<p>Within the vast ocean of algebraic geometry, my current research interest lies in higher dimensional
  (4, to be specific) abelian varieties and the K3 surfaces related to them.</p>

<p>These abelian fourfolds are fun because they are the first family of examples of non-PEL type abelian varieties. Special cases of them,
say, those with complex multiplication, gives fascinating applications in the study of K3 surfaces. Generalization of such non-PEL constructions
are also exhilarating in a way, since they are related to K3 surfaces with real multiplications and hint at unknown (?) arithmetic properties
of quaternion orders.</p>
